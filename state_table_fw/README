Testing the P4/C Firewall:

A guideline for setting up the complete test environment is available at:
P4WIRE_URL_HERE

1.  Install the Firewall rpm package for your specific SmartNIC:
      http://iconicsp4.cloudapp.net/repo/p4c-firewall/

      To add repository:
        Add the following to /etc/yum.conf at the end of the file:
        [base-p4apps]
        name=P4 apps
        failovermethod=priority
        baseurl=http://iconicsp4.cloudapp.net/repo/
        enabled=1
        gpgcheck=0

      All the available packages can be listed with:
        repoquery -a --repoid=base-p4apps

      To install:
        yum install nfp-sdk6-p4-config-<smartnic>-p4c-firewall-2.00-3.noarch

2.  The Firewall controller and test script will be installed to:
      /opt/nfp_pif/etc/smartnic-configs/<smartnic>-p4c-firewall/

3.    Run the Firewall Controller on the host where the SmartNIC is installed:
      python fw_v2_ctrlr.py -h
      python fw_v2_ctrlr.py -i 111.111.111.111 -t 100

4.  Run the Test Script where you generate your traffic:
      ./p4c-firewall-test.sh <internal port> <external port>
      ./p4c-firewall-test.sh p6p1 p6p2

      Make sure you have downloaded the .pcap files provided in this repo
      Make sure you have tcpreplay installed on your host:
        yum install tcpreplay
      The .pcap files must be in the same directory as the test script.

5.  Setup:
   ______________           ______________
  |   SmartNIC   |         |   DumbNIC    |
  |            p0|---------|p6p1<Internal>|
  |   Firewall   |         |              |
  |            p4|---------|p6p2<External>|
  |______________|         |______________|

  The test script will do the following:
    - Send a packet from <external> to p4: No rule yet -> Drop
    - Send a packet from <internal> to p0: New Flow -> NAT -> Forward to p4
    - Send a packet from <external> to p4: Known Flow -> NAT -> Forward to p0
